PHYSICAL CONNECTIONS
- Arduino UNO: 5V, GND, and A1 (analogue in)
  From its wiki:

    GND = BLACK
    VCC = 5V = RED
    analogue out = BLUE

  From the Arduino UNO pinouts at
  http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=146315.0
  and UNOV3PDF.png, there is no convenient 3-pin connector that has these pins.

  The breadboard has VERTICAL POWER STRIPS and HORIZONTAL CONNECTION STRIPS.

  Just plug the Arduino directly into the 3-pin cable from the sensor shield.

SOFTWARE: IDE
- Main .ino file must have the same name as its containing directory.

SKIP THE IDE. COMPILE DIRECTLY.
- See "build_upload" script, which calls "ino build", which looks in "src/"
  etc.

ARDUINO INTERRUPT USAGE
- Don't use the serial port
